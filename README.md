# Scene-Creation-using-Image-Outpainting

We aim to build a stable diffusion model and evaluate it. Furthermore,
to demonstrate a practical use of the model we employ it for the task of image
outpainting. We can use the diffusion model to generate an entire scene by making
use of reference pixels generated in the original image. This can help us control
minute details in the scene as we would be able to specify what particular area of 
the image is to be modified using text prompts.
